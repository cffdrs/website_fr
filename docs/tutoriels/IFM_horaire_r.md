If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, there are many options for you to retrieve the code and data files:

1. *Download each file* to your computer individually. On the file's GitHub page (e.g. [**PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv**](https://github.com/nrcan-cfs-fire/cffdrs-ng/blob/main/data/PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv)), find the "More file actions" button at the top-right side of the website (denoted "..."), and select "Download". This will begin downloading based on your browser settings. Repeat this for every file.
2. *Download the whole repository* to your computer. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) for more information.
3. *Clone* the whole repository to your computer with Git. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) for more information.
4. *Fork* the repository to create a new repository on GitHub. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) for more information.

Besides the files, ensure you have the required R packages, which are listed at <a href="../../code/FWI2025_R#packages" target="_self">FWI2025_R#packages</a>.

## Data
**PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv** contains hourly weather recorded from a Petawawa Research Forest (PRF) weather station during the 2007 field season. The data has no gaps and is sorted sequentially by time, which is a requirement for FWI2025 input data.

The column headers are those required for hourly FWI calculations, details of which can be found in the [code documentation]. Grassland fuel load (`grass_fuel_load`), grassland curing (`percent_cured`) and solar radiation (`solrad`) are not included, but these are optional inputs and they will be automatically calculated if not provided. There is a column for UTC offset (`timezone`) which will be used by default in the `hFWI()` function.

## Steps
Open the **tutorial_hourly_FWI.r** code file. You can either follow the code and comments in the file or continue on this page (both include the same code and content).

### Load libraries
Run `install.packages()` to install any you are missing
```r
library(lubridate)
library(data.table)
```

### Load functions and data
Check your current working directory
```r
getwd()
```
If the working directory is different from where you saved the FWI2025 scripts, change the working directory with `setwd()` to that folder.  

Load the files containing the functions and variables to calculate FWI2025.
```r
source("NG_FWI.r")
source("util.r")
source("daily_summaries.r")
```

Load the input weather station data file. The path below is specified based on the layout in the GitHub repository. Change the file path for **PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv** if your structure is different.
```r
data <- read.csv("../../data/PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv")
```

Print the column names, data should contain 12 columns
```r
print(names(data))
```
```r
 [1] "id"       "lat"      "long"     "timezone" "yr"       "mon"
 [7] "day"      "hr"       "temp"     "rh"       "ws"       "prec"
```

Previously, the UTC offset (`timezone` column) was a function parameter and could be calculated from latitude and longitude. Now it is a data frame column and provided. See the <a href="#appendix-timezones" target="_self">appendix of this tutorial</a> for extra information on how to calculate the timezone, along with the extra information required about the dataset.

### Run FWI2025
`hFWI()` is the function that calculates hourly FWI codes in FWI2025. Details about it can be found in the [code documentation]. It can handle multiple stations and years/fire seasons (not shown in this tutorial). For the arguments you can run `args()`.
```r
args(hFWI)
```
```r
function (df_wx, timezone = NA, ffmc_old = FFMC_DEFAULT, mcffmc_old = NA, 
    dmc_old = DMC_DEFAULT, dc_old = DC_DEFAULT, mcgfmc_matted_old = ffmc_to_mcffmc(FFMC_DEFAULT),
    mcgfmc_standing_old = ffmc_to_mcffmc(FFMC_DEFAULT), prec_cumulative = 0,
    canopy_drying = 0, silent = FALSE, round_out = 4)
```

For this tutorial, we will leave all the optional parameters to default.
```r
data_fwi <- hFWI(data)
```
```r
########
Startup values used:
FFMC = 85.0 or mcffmc = NA %
DMC = 6.0 and DC = 15.0
mcgfmc matted = 16.3075 % and standing = 16.3075 %
cumulative precipitation = 0.0 mm and canopy drying = 0

Running PRF for 2007
########
```

Output is a data.frame (matching input class), with FWI calculations appended after the input columns. Save the output as a CSV file (overrides any preexisting file).
```r
write.csv(data_fwi, "PRF2007_hourly_FWI.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Print the last two rows of the standard moisture codes and fire behaviour indices.
```r
standard_components <- c("ffmc", "dmc", "dc", "isi", "bui", "fwi")
tail(data_fwi[standard_components], 2)
```
```r
        ffmc    dmc       dc    isi    bui    fwi
2622 80.2669 3.0924 219.5169 1.6423 5.9745 0.7650
2623 82.1759 3.3503 220.0533 2.1462 6.4550 1.2023
```

Print a simple summary of the standard FWI components.
```r
summary(data_fwi[standard_components])
```
```r
      ffmc            dmc               dc              isi

Compare your outputs with our standard outputs in [**PRF2007_standard_hourly_FWI.csv**](https://github.com/nrcan-cfs-fire/cffdrs-ng/blob/main/data/PRF2007_standard_hourly_FWI.csv).

### Calculate daily summaries
Calculate outputs like peak burn time and number of hours of spread potential. Details about the daily summaries function can be found in the [code documentation].
```r
report <- generate_daily_summaries(data_fwi)
```

Print a simple summary of the daily report.

```r
daily_components <- c("peak_hr", "duration", "isi_smooth", "dsr")
summary(report[daily_components])
```
```r
    peak_hr         duration        isi_smooth          dsr
 Min.   :13.00   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   :0.0000

 Max.   :23.00   Max.   :14.000   Max.   :15.771   Max.   :6.9486
```

From here, the outputs can be converted to any datatype for further analysis or plotted for visualization.

## Appendix: Timezones
This section will cover how to calculate a timezone based on a location (latitude and longitude) and date. Note that this is not necessarily a substitute for actual information about the time used in a dataset. The [CFFDRS Weather Guide](https://ostrnrcan-dostrncan.canada.ca/handle/1845/219568) specifies to collect data by local standard time, which is different in many places due to the shift to daylight time in summer months (daylight savings).

The 'lutz' library has functions to get the timezone of the weather station based on latitude and longitude.
```r
library(lutz)
```

First, make a dataframe of stations with unique ID, latitude, and longitude.

```r
stations <- unique(data[c("id", "lat", "long")])
```

Print the unique station IDs and coordinates. For this dataset the only station is at Petawawa Research Forest (PRF).
```r
> stations
   id    lat    long
1 PRF 45.996 -77.427
```

Find the timezone based on latitude and longitude, this can take some time. You may need to download the package 'sf' for method = "accurate".
```r
tz_loc <- tz_lookup_coords(stations$lat, stations$long, method = "accurate")
```

Print the timezone location. PRF is equivalent to "America/Toronto".
```r
> tz_loc
[1] "America/Toronto"
```

The UTC offset can then be determined from the timezone location.
```r
utc <- tz_offset("2007-05-10", tz_loc)[[5]]
```

Print the UTC offset.
```r
> utc
[1] -4
```

Since May 10, 2007 is during daylight savings the UTC offset calculated above corresponds to Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), UTC-4. This matches the timezone column provided since this data was collected using EDT. For Eastern Standard Time (EST), the UTC offset would be UTC-5.
