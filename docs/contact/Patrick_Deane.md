Patrick is a Forest Fire Research Specialist with the Canadian Forest Service based out of the Great Lakes Forestry Centre in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. 

Patrick works closely with Dr Chelene Hanes, supporting her research on fire behavior, fire weather, and drought impacts on wildfire activity. In addition to collaborating with fellow researchers, Patrick often works directly with operational fire management staff to implement research practices to aid in decision-making. Patrick is heavily involved in the collection of field data, including setup and maintenance of environmental stations, as well as data management and analysis that contribute towards tools and models within the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System.

Prior to starting with the Canadian Forest Service, Patrick attended McMaster University where his graduate research focused on ecohydrological approaches to fuel management in peatland ecosystems in the boreal region of Alberta. Patrick also spent two seasons as a wildland firefighter in Alberta. These experiences continue to provide important context and inform his research activities.
