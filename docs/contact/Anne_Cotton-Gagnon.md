Anne is a Forest Fire Research Officers with the Canadian Forest Service based out of the Laurentian Forestry Centre in Quebec city, Quebec. She contributes to the majority of Jonathan Boucher’s team research projects, leading and/or supporting components such as field work preparation and realisation, statistical and spatial analyses, publication, presentation, and knowledge exchange with collaborators and partners. Her research interests include, but are not limited to, mitigation actions at the wildland urban interface, suppression effectiveness, and the use of experimental burns to better understand fire behavior. Her main motivation throughout her work remains the relationships built with the fire world actors, and the enriching conversations, exchanges and projects that result from them.
 
Anne has done her undergraduate studies in biology, then a Master’s degree in geographical sciences looking at the spruce budworm impact on balsam fir and black spruce regeneration, both at Laval University. 
After another year of studies in forestry and geomatics, she obtained her membership to the Ordre des Ingénieurs Forestiers du Québec (RPF for the province of Quebec). She had already been working as a student at the Laurentian Forestry Centre since her first undergraduate summer and switched to being a Forest Officer on forest soils, biomass and entomology in 2018. In 2021, she obtained her current position in wildfire research in Jonathan Boucher’s team, which has kept her highly motivated ever since.
